In the café “Étoile du Nord,” nestled in the heart of München, patrons sip on matcha 🍵 and espresso ☕ while
discussing Gödel’s incompleteness theorems (∀x ∈ ℕ, ∃y ∈ ℕ such that…). Outside, the sign reads “Добро пожаловать”
in Cyrillic, welcoming guests from afar. A child sketches a dragon: 龍, while her father hums a tune in Hindi:
“सपनों की दुनिया.” Nearby, a mathematician jots down: ∑_{i=1}^∞ 1/i² = π²/6. The air is filled with laughter—“¡Olé!”
shouts a flamenco dancer 💃—and the scent of bánh mì wafts from the kitchen. Even the Wi-Fi password is quirky:
“Διασκέδαση_123!” Life here is a mosaic of languages, symbols, and stories—each character a thread in the
tapestry of humanity.
